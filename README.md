Function signin takes id and password data from the last token.<br>
If need to make a search for a POST request with the parameters of the ID and password, write to me.<br>
function logout: So far I have not found a principle by which it can be properly implemented.<br>
POST<br>
{<br>
    "user_id": "john@gmail.com",<br>
    "id_type": "email",<br>
    "password" : "123456"<br>
}<br>
